This blog is intentionally simple:

- No backend
- No database
- No admin dashboard
- Content lives in local Markdown files

<Callout type="info" title="Design Goal">
Keep the writing workflow lightweight and keep the rendering predictable.
</Callout>

I only need one command to run the project locally.

```bash
pnpm dev
```
